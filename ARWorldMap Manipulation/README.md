# AR World MAp Manipulation #

When viewing very large virtual objects with the AR camera, there is the problem that this virtual object deviates from the position it should have in the real world as you move towards the distant point of the object. Sought a solution for this monitoring problem via ARKit for In order to improve the interaction between the real world and the virtual world.

Through this project, it aims to provide a better augmented reality experience to the user by preserving the integrity of the object with the real world and increasing the sense of reality while monitoring very large virtual objects. This study collects real-world map information while monitoring virtual objects in the real world, manipulates the map information, and reduces the deviation rate of the virtual object from the real world real position.
